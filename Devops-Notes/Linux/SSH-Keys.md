No, you cannot directly convert a public SSH key to its corresponding private key, or vice versa. The relationship between the public and private keys is one-way, meaning you can derive the public key from the private key, but not the other way around.

The public key is meant to be shared with others, while the private key must be kept secure and should never be revealed to anyone. If you lose your private key, you will not be able to recover it from the public key.

However, you can perform the following operations:

## Regenerating a Public Key from a Private Key

If you have the private key and want to regenerate the corresponding public key, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command with the `-y` option:

```bash
ssh-keygen -y -f /path/to/private_key > /path/to/public_key.pub
```

This command takes the private key file as input and generates the public key file.

## Converting Between OpenSSH and SSH2 Formats

The public key format can be converted between OpenSSH and SSH2 formats using the `ssh-keygen` command with the `-i` (import) or `-e` (export) options:

```bash
# Convert SSH2 to OpenSSH
ssh-keygen -i -f ssh2_public_key.pub > openssh_public_key.pub

# Convert OpenSSH to SSH2
ssh-keygen -e -f openssh_public_key.pub > ssh2_public_key.pub
```

These commands convert the public key format without affecting the actual key itself.

In summary, while you cannot directly convert between public and private keys, you can regenerate a public key from its corresponding private key, and convert between different public key formats like OpenSSH and SSH2.
