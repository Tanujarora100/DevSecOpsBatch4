## **Communication Methods Across Namespaces**

### **1. Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)**
To communicate between pods in different namespaces, you can use the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the service. The FQDN format is:

```
<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local
```

For example, if you have a service named `web-app-service` in the namespace `test-namespace`, the FQDN would be:

```
web-app-service.test-namespace.svc.cluster.local
```

Using this FQDN, any pod in any namespace can resolve and communicate with the service in `test-namespace`.

### **2. Kubernetes Services**
Kubernetes services provide a stable endpoint for accessing a group of pods. When pods need to communicate across namespaces, they should use the service's DNS name as mentioned above. This abstracts the underlying pod IPs and handles load balancing and failover.

#### Example:
If `svc-a` is a service in namespace `ns-a` and `svc-b` is in namespace `ns-b`, a pod in `ns-a` can reach `svc-b` using:

```
svc-b.ns-b.svc.cluster.local
```
### **3. Network Policies**
Network policies can be defined to control the traffic between pods, including those in different namespaces. 
- By default, Kubernetes allows all pods to communicate with each other, but network policies can restrict this behavior.

#### Example Network Policy:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-ns-b
  namespace: ns-a
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: ns-b
```

This policy allows pods in `ns-a` to accept traffic from pods in `ns-b`.
