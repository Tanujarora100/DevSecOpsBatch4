- A proxy repository acts as a caching proxy for a remote repository, fetching artifacts from external sources and storing them locally to improve performance and availability.

### What is Nexus Smart Proxy and how does it enhance performance?
- Nexus Smart Proxy extends repository proxies to remote locations, providing local caching and faster access to artifacts for geographically distributed teams.

- You encounter a situation where a proxy repository is not syncing artifacts. How would you troubleshoot this issue.
### Check the network connectivity between Nexus and the remote repository.
- Verify the remote repository URL and credentials.
- Review the Nexus logs.
- Clear the proxy cache and attempt to sync again.

### What strategies would you use for managing large numbers of artifacts in Nexus?
- Implementing cleanup policies.
- Using repository groups to simplify access and organization.

### How can you secure access to repositories in Nexus?
- Create roles and assign permissions 
- Create users and assign them the appropriate roles.
