### INIT CONTAINERS
- Runs before the main containers and perform initialization
- They are sequential in nature 
- App do not start unless all are completed
- Contains Utilities or setup scripts
- Isolated and have own environment and file system
- If an init container fails, the podâ€™s restart policy determines the next steps. 
- For Always or OnFailure policies, the pod will restart from the first init container.
- The pod status will show Init:Error or Init:CrashLoopBackOff if there are repeated failures.

```
### CONS OF INIT CONTAINERS
- Resource Allocation and Scheduling
    - Resource Requests and Limits:
    - The highest resource request or limit specified across all init containers becomes the effective request/limit for the init phase. This means that init containers can reserve significant resources during initialization, which might not be used during the pod's runtime.
    - Since scheduling is based on the effective requests/limits, init containers can affect the scheduling of the pod. Pods with high resource requests for init containers might wait longer to be scheduled if the cluster is resource-constrained.
- Initialization Time
- Handling Failures: If an init container fails, the pod will restart according to its restart policy, which can lead to repeated initialization attempts and potential delays in application startup.
